                        <p>In my teaching philosophy, I recognize the importance of science education as not just the transmission of knowledge but also as a form of scientific communication. It is crucial to actively engage and inspire young scientists from diverse backgrounds, challenging the prevailing white, cis-centric perception of science. Currently, I am deeply involved as a volunteer in the RiseUp North East Ohio program, where we encourage students from underserved communities in Cleveland to explore college degrees and careers in science. My role includes mentoring in their "Life of a Scientist" program, where high school students learn about the steps involved in research, including the review and funding of their research ideas. They spend the school year conducting experiments, with the goal of publishing their findings in their own journal. As part of these initiatives, I teach high school students essential skills in machine learning, programming, and engineering, emphasizing their relevance in the field of biomedical research. I am eager to share my experiences with students and highlight the significant role of technology in cancer healthcare.</p>

                        <p>For many low-income and minority high school students, traditional unpaid summer internships are not feasible options. Thus, supporting programs like RiseUP that integrate outreach into school curriculums and provide paid summer research opportunities is essential to enhancing access. Furthermore, I am a staunch advocate for underrepresented communities, both within academia and my local community. In collaboration with the Greater Cleveland LGBT+ center, I am dedicated to improving access to education, employment, and healthcare for trans individuals, particularly people of color. My commitment extends to academia, where I am part of the organizing team for the inaugural "Queer in Computational and Applied Math" conference, funded by ICERM and hosted by Brown University in the summer of 2024. I also actively promote trans accessibility for conferences, advocating for remote and alternative participation options, particularly in states that may be unsafe for trans people. Additionally, I am working with other trans academics on a manuscript about intersectional trans allyship in academia, utilizing systems dynamics and leverage points to provide guidance on how privilege and capacity can facilitate positive systemic change.</p>
